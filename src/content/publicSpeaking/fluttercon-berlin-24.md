**Tired of boring M&M mixes?** Take control with Flutter! This talk dives into building a custom M&M dispenser you control with code, powered by the mighty Raspberry Pi 5.

We'll ditch the screens and get our hands dirty (well, maybe not that dirty) as we:

– Craft a sweet user interface to pick your perfect M&M color combo.\
– Unlock the secrets of connecting Flutter to real-world hardware (cue the M&M rain!).\
– Learn how to make your own interactive Flutter projects beyond the phone, leveraging the power of Raspberry Pi 5.

Get ready for a sugar rush of knowledge (and maybe some real M&Ms)! This session features a live demo of the M&M dispenser on stage, so you can create your own custom mix.

Calling all curious coders! This talk is perfect if you want to see Flutter in action on Raspberry Pi 5 and build something fun - with a delicious reward.
