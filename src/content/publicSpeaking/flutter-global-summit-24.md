Flutter's unique architecture and capabilities make it well-suited for creating high-performance, visually appealing applications on resource-constrained devices such as the Raspberry Pi. In this talk, we embark on a journey to explore the potential of Flutter in the realm of embedded devices. We'll delve into the intricacies of running Flutter on embedded devices, utilizing the Raspberry Pi as our development platform. Together, we'll construct an Indoor Air-Quality-Meter using Flutter, a SCD41-CO2 Sensor, and embedded Linux, demonstrating the practical applications of Flutter in the IoT ecosystem. To achieve this we'll make use of the D-Bus, the ubiquitous inter-process-communication channel on Linux systems and find out how we can use it to transfer data from a Sensor into our Flutter Application.
