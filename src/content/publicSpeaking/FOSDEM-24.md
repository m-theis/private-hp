We may not have realized it yet, but Flutter could become the next big player on embedded devices. This talk aims to show the potential of Flutter on embedded devices, to give a practical guide on how to start developing Flutter with a Raspberry Pi on embedded Linux, and to showcase a project where Flutter connects to the Internet of Things. What's currently supported and what custom Embedder can we use to achieve this? How do we communicate between Flutter and the embedded hardware? How can we integrate and use Flutter in the Maker-Community to open up to the world of IoT? All of these points will be answered in the talk which is accompanied by a working-code example that can be checked out afterwards.
