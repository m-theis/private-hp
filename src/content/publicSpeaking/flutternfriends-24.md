**This workshop dives into running Flutter on embedded devices**, specifically setting it up on the brand new Raspberry Pi 5.

In 3 small groups we will set up Flutter on a Raspberry Pi 5, write our first small App for it and learn to control an externally connected servo-motor to dispense some delicious M&M's trough our Flutter-Application.

We will have 5 Raspberry Pi 5's and touchscreens for the audience with me so that small groups can work interactively along while we go trough everything.

While the first 90 minutes are the same for all of the audience, the last 30 minutes can be used to explore and build something individual with the servo engines and the Raspberry Pi's for each group.
