His talk will dive into running Flutter on embedded devices, specifically setting it up on the brand new Raspberry Pi 5. We'll explore the differences between mobile/desktop and embedded Flutter development, and why custom embedders like Flutter-Pi, the Sony-Embedder, and the Toyota-Embedder exist.
