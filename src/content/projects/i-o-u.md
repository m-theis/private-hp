## IOU - I Owe You

You probably know the situation: a meal together, a relaxed drink - and then the eternal question: "Who owes whom?" No more of that! IOU stands for "I Owe You", but we're not about money. IOU is the app that shifts the focus from annoying financial obligations to culinary experiences. Instead of painstakingly splitting bills, we focus on documenting the moments when friends generously buy the next round of drinks or a delicious snack. IOU is a project in its own right. We use the app to be able to talk openly with our customers about the costs and features/areas of an app.

### Features

- **Shared Lists**: Collaborate on lists with friends, ensuring everyone stays up-to-date automatically.
- **Automatic Expense Chronicle**: IOU automatically logs shared expenses, keeping track effortlessly.
- **Edit Entries**: Easily edit entries post-submission for accuracy and clarity.
- **Clear Overview**: Get a comprehensive summary of expenses, highlighting who's been treating others. Everything neatly summarized and visually appealing.
