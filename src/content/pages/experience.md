### Background as an Automotive Engineer

Before transitioning into software development, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Automotive Engineering from Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. During my studies, I was an active member of Formula Student, contributing to the development of an formula race car as part of Highspeed-Karlsruhe. This experience sharpened my skills in interdisciplinary teamwork, blending mechanical engineering with software systems. It also deepened my passion for innovation and precision—qualities I continue to apply in my software development career

### Master's in Technology Entrepreneurship

In addition to my engineering background, I pursued a Master’s degree in Technology Entrepreneurship at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. My thesis focused on Behavioral Product Design Patterns, which provided me with valuable insights into the intersection of behavioral sciences and digital product design. This academic experience honed my ability to innovate, conceptualize, and lead tech-based projects, equipping me with the entrepreneurial mindset to successfully launch and scale ventures like Snapp X.
